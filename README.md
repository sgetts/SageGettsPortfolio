<h1>EXOS Cyber Club - Mentoring & Knowledge Sharing</h1>
<h4>I founded the Exos CySec Club at my company, where a work colleague from our Cyber division and I mentor employees in real-world offensive and defensive cybersecurity methodologies. In this club, I teach hands-on pentesting skills, defensive strategies, and cutting-edge cybersecurity tools. Our focus is on enhancing practical skills that directly impact our work, empowering team members to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape. The club fosters a collaborative environment where we explore challenges, share knowledge, and grow as a team.</h4>
